# friend_finder

Description: 

This is a full stack web application designed with node and express. The app is “pet themed” and designed to help pets find “furry friends”. This app allows users to complete surveys, then it compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. This app was deployed on Heroku.


Challenges: 

Creation of this app resulted in a few challenges. One challenge occurred with correctly creating the API and HTML routes. Learning the correct formatting proved to help aid during this challenge. Another challenge was creating the modal due to lack of experience with this task. Through researching the Bootstrap documentation, I created a modal with a picture and name of the corresponding friend.
